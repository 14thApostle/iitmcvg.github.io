__Early stage TB detection__ (JIPMER collaboration): Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease in adults and is the worldâ€™s biggest killer of women.
We are working on using breath sounds recorded under real practitioner conditions for early detection of tuberculosis so that we can cure it before it becomes too infectious.
