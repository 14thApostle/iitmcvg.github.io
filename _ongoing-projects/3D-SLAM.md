Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping is a rather useful addition for most robotic systems, wherein the vision module takes in a video stream and attempts to map the entire field of view. This allows for all sorts of "smart" bots, such as those constrained to perform a given task. A really good read onto what SLAM is can be found [here](https://nicolovaligi.com/deep-learning-robotics-slam.html). We aim to build a more robust pipeline by incorporating Deep Learning tools at junctions where the tradeoff between speed and accuracy is profitable.
