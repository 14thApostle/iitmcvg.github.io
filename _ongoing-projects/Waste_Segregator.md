title: "Automatic Waste Segregator"
description: "For dynamic and effective solid waste management"
---
India generates 62 million tonnes of solid waste per annum. A major part of this in not managed properly and is often just dumped in landfill sites. Almost all municipal authorities deposit solid waste at a dumpyard within or outside the city haphazardly. Experts believe that India is following a flawed system of waste disposal and management.The key to efficient waste management is to ensure proper segregation of waste at the source.
In order to solve Indiaâ€™s exponentially growing issue of solid waste management, while recognising the need for dynamic and effective sorting at the grassroot level, we are working on building a small scale and municipal level segregator. The initial prototype has already been completed for this, and presently we are aiming to scale to the municipal level.
