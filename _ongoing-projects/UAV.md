During a disaster, it is extremely hard for officials to be able to survey the area when they themselves cannot move about easily. Furthermore, when the affected area is large or critically hit, it is not humanly possible to search the entire area in enough time to save all survivors.
The main aim of this project is to create a product which will improve upon the present disaster-relief operations scenario and can also serve purposes such as SAR missions,surveillance tasks,etc. We are planning to deploy a team of interconnected autonomous drones which will use effective path-planning algorithms and obstacle avoidance techniques using Computer Vision and will distribute themselves over the affected zone. The drones will utilize state-of-the-art deep learning models to extract essential information like number of survivors,the severity of situation and then transmit this information along with images and live video to the base station.
