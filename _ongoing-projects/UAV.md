Disaster relief at present has the dual disadvantage of being cut off from resources and being a risk for the rescue teams deployed. Our main aim is to create a product which will improve upon and assist the present disaster-relief operations scenario while additionally serving purposes such as SAR missions,surveillance tasks,etc.

We are planning to deploy a team of interconnected autonomous drones which will use effective path-planning algorithms and obstacle avoidance techniques using Computer Vision and will distribute themselves over the affected zone. The drones will utilize state-of-the-art deep learning models to extract essential information like number of survivors,the severity of situation and then transmit this information along with images and live video to the base station.
