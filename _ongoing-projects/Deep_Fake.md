__Deep Fake__ (Deep Learning + Fake) is a human image synthesis technique using artificial intelligence methods. It has often been used for doing face swaps, especially with celebrities.
This project aims to develop a robust and fast face morphing system for images and video, using Autoencoders and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).The main application of the project is to make personalised marketing software for clothes and fashion items in online retail stores.
