description: "Super resolution of an image using Efficient subpixel Phase Shift CNNs"
---
This project was aimed at implementing a CSI ( TV Serial )  style Resolution enhancer for images. A Deep Learning Super Resolution approach was adopted, and traditional transposed convolutions, generally used for upsampling in Deep Learning, was replaced by an Efficient Subsampling Method based on the Phase Shift approach.
