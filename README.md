## Convert .ipynb to a Blog post

If you would not like to export your notebook manually, you can choose to use the conversion script. This will  convert the notebook into a markdown file with the appropriate templating.

The .ipynb notebook may be referenced from anywhere on your local machine.

To use the same:

```
usage: convert_nb.py [-h] -nb NOTEBOOK -t TITLE -d DESCRIPTION [-e] [-ty TYPE]
                     [-bp BLOGPATH]

Convert .ipynb notebook into a blog post

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -nb NOTEBOOK, --notebook NOTEBOOK
                        notebook path
  -t TITLE, --title TITLE
                        Title of article [post|page|any class type]
  -d DESCRIPTION, --description DESCRIPTION
                        Description of article
  -e, --execute         Execute the jupyter notebook before converting
  -ty TYPE, --type TYPE
                        notebook type
  -bp BLOGPATH, --blogpath BLOGPATH
                        Blogsite path
```

## Comment Policy (Disqus)

We have largely based our policy on this : _The Mary Sue_: [The Mary Sueâ€™s Comment Policy](http://www.themarysue.com/comment-policy/)

We might change this as we proceed.

## Form Submissions

* [Staticman](https://staticman.net/docs/)
* [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)

---

## MathJax Support

Added by using the `use_math` tag.

For now defaulted it to every post, page. Will revert in the future in case the pages slow down.

References for the Syntax:

* https://gist.github.com/mikelove/cbf6eb431406852ba725
* http://www.dianacai.com/blog/2015/09/12/making-blog/
* And Ofcourse this: http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/

We'll stick to kramdown render (for markdown), since it plays fairly nice with both Jekyll 3.x and MathJax.
