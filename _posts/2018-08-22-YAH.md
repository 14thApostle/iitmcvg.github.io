# Yet Another Hackathon (YAH!) 2018

A team from CVI, named "Eye in the Sky", participated in YAH! 2k18.

**We have an inter-disciplinary project going on in CFI which is in collaboration with CVI and Aero club.**

**The team,  won the runner up prize worth 10000 rupees.**

There were three subdomains in the competition and the team had to work on any one of them, these subdomains were:

* New innovation and implementation in public services : Under the domain of Governance.

* Gaming with a purpose : Under the domain of Education.

* Personal Security : Under the domain of Security.

The team chose to work on the subdomain of public services; specifically targeting Emergency Services and the use of Drones in Disaster management, employing real time Deep Learning and path planning algorithms in the codebase:

### Our unique selling points 

* Doing live person detection with the help of highly optimised YOLO architecture using Tensorflow API.

* Achieving live video transfer - where the drone and laptop were not connected physically at all - and also sending accurate GPS coordinates to the base-station whenever a person is detected so that the relief forces can go out there and save him/her.

* Achieving live Activity Recognition for an SOS signal done by a person during a disaster. This SOS signal includes raising both your hands and waving in front of the drone continously as a sign of asking for immediate Help Requirement . Also this idea is not implemented and present on the internet till date and it is atleast 3 times faster than the fastest available method for Activity Recognition - which relies on using 3D convolution of frames across time.

* Making an interactive demo where in a user can zoom-in on the map of India and draw a rectangle around the disaster affected area after which a team of drones will go and distribute themselves in such a way so that the area survielled by the team of drones is maximum.

Also the team would like to specially thank  the CVI club heads **Lokesh Kumar and Varun Sundar** for their guidance and mentorship.
