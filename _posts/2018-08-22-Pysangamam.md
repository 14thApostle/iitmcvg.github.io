We are pleased to announce that 3 of our talk proposals from the Computer Vision and Intelligence group (CVI) have been selected as a part of [PySangamam 2018](https://pysangamam.org). 

* **Lokesh Kumar** would be covering an introductory talk on using numba for GPU parallelism in python.
* **Nikhil Krishna** would be delivering a talk titled "Gentle Introduction to Effective Parallelism via Computer Vision."
* **Rajat V D** will be covering a talk on python generators and its use cases in Deep Learning

We will also be conducting a workshop titled "Computer Vision through the Ages", where we would take you along the evolution of Computer vision since the last two decades, cover factors that influence the field the most today and provide intuiton on the approaches taken in this period.

We're super excited to be a part of PySangamam 2018, see you there too!
