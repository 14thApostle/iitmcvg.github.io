We are in 2018, a year where computer vision seems more dominated by Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning than photogrammetry, and when  language is the next big barrier to be crossed. Where does one then start on understanding each domain and their cross-linking? With a bit of fooling around in these topics, we attempt to piece out a slightly coherent path.

How one goes about this is still quite conflicting- for instance a lot skip classical computer vision (processing and filter based) and get away with neural nets for pattern recognition. We are open to suggestions in the path advised, so feel free to drop in your comments below.

For those who would like a really extensive list of references, we have a compiled list in our content repository, similar to an _Awesome Deep Vision_ initiative. This can be found [here](https://github.com/iitmcvg/Content), under the _References_ folder.

Here are some references to get started with Computer Vision, Deep Learning and AI in general:

We have included jupyter notebooks for most computer vision techniques under our [Content](https://github.com/iitmcvg/Content) repository. This is a work in progress, so do feel free to hit up a pull request for certain notebooks.
